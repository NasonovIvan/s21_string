# s21_string

# Introduction
In this project I developed my own implementation of the string.h library in C programming language with some additions (with my own implementation of sprintf). The string.h library is the main C library for string processing.

# Information
The C programming language has a set of functions implementing operations on strings (character strings and byte strings) in its standard library. Various operations, such as copying, concatenation, tokenization and searching are supported. For character strings, the standard library uses the convention that strings are null-terminated: a string of n characters is represented as an array of n + 1 elements, the last of which is a "NULL" character. 
The only support for strings in the programming language proper is that the compiler translates quoted string constants into null-terminated strings.

# Start program

After cloning this repo, enter the following command in the s21_string directory:

To create a library, test its functions and get a [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/) html-report on the coverage of functions with tests:
```sh
make
```

For building the library *s21_string.a*:
```sh
make s21_math.a
```

For testing the functions:
```sh
make test
```

If you want to check the code using *cpplint* or *valgrind*, use the commands:
```sh
make cpplint
```
or
```sh
make valgrind
```

>The commands assume that you have a gcc compiler and some utilities installed!

### string.h Macro

| No. | Macro | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | NULL | This macro is the value of a null pointer constant. |

### string.h Functions

| No. | Function | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | void *memchr(const void *str, int c, size_t n) | Searches for the first occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the first n bytes of the string pointed to, by the argument str. |
| 2 | int memcmp(const void *str1, const void *str2, size_t n) | Compares the first n bytes of str1 and str2. |
| 3 | void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n) | Copies n characters from src to dest. |
| 4 | void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n) | Another function to copy n characters from src to dest. |
| 5 | void *memset(void *str, int c, size_t n) | Copies the character c (an unsigned char) to the first n characters of the string pointed to, by the argument str. |
| 6 | char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src) | Appends the string pointed to, by src to the end of the string pointed to by dest. |
| 7 | char *strncat(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n) | Appends the string pointed to, by src to the end of the string pointed to, by dest up to n characters long. |
| 8	| char *strchr(const char *str, int c) | Searches for the first occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the string pointed to, by the argument str. |
| 9 | int strcmp(const char *str1, const char *str2) | Compares the string pointed to, by str1 to the string pointed to by str2. |
| 10 | int strncmp(const char *str1, const char *str2, size_t n) | Compares at most the first n bytes of str1 and str2. |

| 14 | char *strerror(int errnum) | Searches an internal array for the error number errnum and returns a pointer to an error message string. You need to declare macros containing arrays of error messages for mac and linux operating systems. Error descriptions are available in the original library. Checking the current OS is carried out using directives. |

| 17 | char *strrchr(const char *str, int c) | Searches for the last occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the string pointed to by the argument str. |
| 18 | size_t strspn(const char *str1, const char *str2) | Calculates the length of the initial segment of str1 which consists entirely of characters in str2. |
| 19 | char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle) | Finds the first occurrence of the entire string needle (not including the terminating null character) which appears in the string haystack. |
| 20 | char *strtok(char *str, const char *delim) | Breaks string str into a series of tokens separated by delim. |

### sprintf

- int sprintf(char *str, const char *format, ...) - sends formatted output to a string pointed to, by str.

where:
- str − This is the C string that the function processes as its source to retrieve the data;
- format − This is the C string that contains one or more of the following items: Whitespace character, Non-whitespace character and Format specifiers. A format specifier for print functions follows this prototype: %[flags][width][.precision][length]specifier. A format specifier for scan functions follows this prototype: %[*][width][length]specifier.

### sprintf Flags

| No. | Flags | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | - | Left-justify within the given field width; Right justification is the default (see width sub-specifier). |
| 2 | + | Forces to precede the result with a plus or minus sign (+ or -) even for positive numbers. By default, only negative numbers are preceded with a -ve sign. |
| 3 | (space) | If no sign is going to be written, a blank space is inserted before the value. |

### sprintf Width Description

| No. |	Width | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1	| (number) | Minimum number of characters to be printed. If the value to be printed is shorter than this number, the result is padded with blank spaces. The value is not truncated even if the result is larger. |
| 2 | * | In sprintf the * sign means, that the width is not specified in the format string, but as an additional integer value argument preceding the argument that has to be formatted. In sscanf the * sign placed after % and before the format specifier reads data of the specified type, but suppresses their assignment. |

### sprintf Precision Description

| No. |	.precision | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1	| .number | For integer specifiers (d, i, o, u, x, X) − precision specifies the minimum number of digits to be written. If the value to be written is shorter than this number, the result is padded with leading zeros. The value is not truncated even if the result is longer. A precision of 0 means that no character is written for the value 0. For e, E and f specifiers − this is the number of digits to be printed after the decimal point. For g and G specifiers − This is the maximum number of significant digits to be printed. For s − this is the maximum number of characters to be printed. By default all characters are printed until the ending null character is encountered. For c type − it has no effect. When no precision is specified for specifiers e, E, f, g and G, the default one is 6. When no precision is specified for all other kind of specifiers, the default is 1. If the period is specified without an explicit value for precision, 0 is assumed. |
| 2	| .* | The precision is not specified in the format string, but as an additional integer value argument preceding the argument that has to be formatted. |

### sprintf Length Description

| No. |	Length | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | h | The argument is interpreted as a short int or unsigned short int (only applies to integer specifiers: i, d, o, u, x and X). |
| 2 | l | The argument is interpreted as a long int or unsigned long int for integer specifiers (i, d, o, u, x and X), and as a wide character or wide character string for specifiers c and s. |
| 3 | L | The argument is interpreted as a long double (only applies to floating point specifiers − e, E, f, g and G). |

### Special string processing functions (from the String class in C#)

| No. | Function | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | void *to_upper(const char *str) | Returns a copy of string (str) converted to uppercase. In case of any error, return NULL |
| 2 | void *to_lower(const char *str) | Returns a copy of string (str) converted to lowercase. In case of any error, return NULL |
| 3 | void *insert(const char *src, const char *str, size_t start_index) | Returns a new string in which a specified string (str) is inserted at a specified index position (start_index) in the given string (src). In case of any error, return NULL |
| 4 | void *trim(const char *src, const char *trim_chars) | Returns a new string in which all leading and trailing occurrences of a set of specified characters (trim_chars) from the given string (src) are removed. In case of any error, return NULL |

## Implementation of the string.h library functions

- The library developed in C language of C11 standard using gcc compiler
 - It made as a static library (with the header file s21_string.h)
 - Full coverage of the library's functions by unit-tests using the Check library
 - Unit-tests check the results of implementation by comparing them with the implementation of the standard string.h library
 - Unit tests cover at least 80% of each function (checked using gcov)
 - Makefile is provided for building the library and tests (with the targets all, clean, test, s21_string.a, gcov_report)
 - The gcov_report target generate a gcov report in the form of an html page. Unit tests run with gcov flags to do this
 - Functions work with z-string made of single-byte characters in ASCII encoding.

## Implementation of the sprintf function

- The next partial formatting are supported:
  - Specifiers: c, d, i, f, s, u, %
  - Flags: -, +, (space)
  - Width description: (number)
  - Precision description: .(number)
  - Length description: h, l

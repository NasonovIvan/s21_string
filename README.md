# s21_string

# Introduction
In this project I developed my own implementation of the string.h library in C programming language with some additions (with my own implementation of sprintf). The string.h library is the main C library for string processing.

# Information
The C programming language has a set of functions implementing operations on strings (character strings and byte strings) in its standard library. Various operations, such as copying, concatenation, tokenization and searching are supported. For character strings, the standard library uses the convention that strings are null-terminated: a string of n characters is represented as an array of n + 1 elements, the last of which is a "NULL" character. 
The only support for strings in the programming language proper is that the compiler translates quoted string constants into null-terminated strings.
